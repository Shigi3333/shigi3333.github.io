description: This was an educational internship that I had to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement for, so I can't describe in too much detail what we did as a team, but the goal of our project was to use OpenCV to develop a co-localization and swarming pipeline based in OpenCV. Our goal was to be able to recognize other lunar rovers via an onboard camera, and extrapolate rough position and orientation information given known geometry for each rover. This was an incredible opportunity, and I got to work with a wonderful team on this project. It was great practice following AGILE development with scrum meetings, and gave us access to enterprise-grade Microsoft Azure and other development environments. Since 2D to 3D Transformation is a relatively open problem, it was also great practice gathering around a table and scanning through technical papers/academic journals for helpful information to come up with a solution as a joint effort.
