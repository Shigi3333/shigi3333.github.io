description: As a highschooler/freshman in college I helped a family friend manage their small business's website. I made small updates and changes to service listings, prices, staff rosters, etc. I also helped edit photos for the on-site gallery so they could display their art and kept it updated with only active staff's work. I was also given some creative freedom to simplify their site and clean up old work from the previous developer, making it easier to manage.
